# Keratocyte-Actin-Model
## Overview
We will confirm the presence or absence of a half moon shaped morphology by changing the intracellular environment (mainly polymerization of actin molecule).
## Description
Cell membrane molecules move under the influence of neighboring membrane molecules and actin molecules. Approximately 6000 such membrane molecules are arranged in a circle, and actin molecules are polymerized to confirm what form is formed as a whole.
